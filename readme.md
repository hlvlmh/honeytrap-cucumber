# Honeytrap Cucumber

Something's vexing her  
More than little bottled up and swallowed  
Nothings — the secret  
Got gaffer for your  
Scarab slipper  

Wax slip, drip silently  
Like blood will dry  
Shut out the sacred  
You're mumbling and  
Man one jumble  

Future's too far (far, far...)  
To cite shift  
Chaff shedding, buddy  
You sense a ceiling?  
There's something travelling besides  

Enveloping, condensing down, down with  
Something bottled up and swallowed  
Shunning the feelings  
Black feeling, numbed dome  
Shatter the ceiling.  

Thine balls they ache  
While saccharine incite revolt...  

Light scaffold  
Over crag pit — hearsay  
They say bad times change  
But I don't agree  
No I don't agree at all  

Future's too near (for)  
Sullen grit  
Menace circling  
It ain't so fair now  
You're retreating, but —  

Give short shrift  
She's good to go  
Find the mind reeling (from)  
Black feeling, a badder bad, a Bada feeling  

No there ain't no sane way out  
Burning infernally amorphous  
Saddle up and soldier on  
A little bit more, just a little bit  
Those shades are sifting.  

Thine balls they ache  
While saccharine incite revolt  
Again.  

One was loathe...  
Too beholden to line  
Taking too far  

That's a no-no  
I've been played like that before  
From elated to down-low  
Hate best papered over  

Gold star rollin'  
To every limit, all known  
All-diggin' — that's where I want to be  
Hams purring overwhelm:  

Huff and puff and hyperventilate  
It's all part of it,  
Why you trippin'?  

I know where all this goes  
I go where all this knows  
What a nap, what a nap —  
Wow!  

Give me short shrift, oh  
Because I'm good to go, yo  
Find the mind reeling  
Black feeling —  
Oh that black feeling, no...  

Wax drift slipping, drip  
Like blood will cry out  
Edit to rolling edit  
Segue to final black  
In vain — no-one beseech thee  

But told swift — goad goat  
Mind peeling out of  
Black reeling spur  
Film burning  

There was something vexing us  
But I've got it bottled up and swallowed  
And I'll sink it with me  
Now end ain't far off  
End ain't far off now...  

Well, I'll be beacon and controller  
Dug deep in the auld other  
Run the tape, won't pause or baulk  
Now I'm done harboring labour  

Happy? Beacon and controller  
Lodged deep in the auld other  
No don't hide or shade thy gold  
Straits die burgeoned over  

None can weight  
Her domino  
Falls as gravity  
As sure as your endeavours  
Fail to replicate
